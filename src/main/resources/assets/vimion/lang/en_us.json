These chapters may appear empty early in the mod, but they will slowly fill up with Objectives as you progress. \n\n\nHovering over an objective in the Objective View part of this GUI will display that Objective's title and a short description of what you have to do to complete it. \n\n\n\n\n\nBefore completing the Objective, it will appear in grey. Clicking on the Objective at this point will take you to an info page that will go into more detail about what you need to do to complete the Objective as well as share a little lore about it. \n\nAfter completing an Objective, it will appear in gold in Objective View. Clicking on it at this point will open up an info page that goes much deeper into its lore as well as giving hints about what you should do next. \n\n\n\nNote that you cannot complete an Objective prior to completing its \"Parent\" Objective (This is usually the Objective you had to complete before it appeared in the Tome). \n\n\n\n\nFor example, you can't complete the \"Craft a Necrion Gemstone\" Objective before completing the \"Craft an Advanced Geologic Phaser\" one.",

If this observation is correct, Vimion is the first known material made entirely of Magic in a stable structure.\n\nThis property seems to be consistent with how malleable Vimion is. While it is most stable in a crystalline gemstone structure, it will readily deform and bind to other substances. This property makes its potential as a tool material by itself small, but the possibility of combining it with other tools to create objects with heightened magical properties is greater than any other known substance!\n\nResearch into this substance is certain to yield fascinating results!",

Instead, eating causes the Spectral Entities to emit a pulse of Vimionic energy that rekindles the aggression of nearby undead mobs towards them. These properties are certain to have plenty of uses, and more properties will likely be discovered in the future.\n\nThe question also still stands why these five mobs are the only ones that can yield their souls to a Vimionite Dagger.

Instead, that glow seems reserved for activating the tool via right-click. In this state, this Spade becomes capable of channeling the energy of its Expion Gemstone's pocket dimension.\n\nWhenever it is used to mine a block that can normally be harvested with the hand and is most effectively mined with a shovel, it will consume 64 of the Spade's durability and drop 64 copies of that block!\n\nEarly tests show that the Expionite spade emits almost exactly 6.3 MJ of a new form of energy when it harvests a valid block while in active mode. This number, combined with the other known properties of Expion, suggests Spade creates and destroys pocket dimensions one cubic meter in size over and over until it has created a stack of items.
